![Flag of Turkmenistan]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/TKM_flag_h240.png) **Turkmenistan**, a desert country in Central Asia, has made progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) since adopting the agenda in 2015. Turkmenistan has undertaken various initiatives to promote sustainable development, such as improving access to clean water and sanitation, and increasing renewable energy use. In 2019, Turkmenistan presented its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the United Nations High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, which provided an overview of the country's progress in implementing the SDGs and identified priorities for future action.
