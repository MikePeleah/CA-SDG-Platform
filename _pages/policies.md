title: Policies for Sustainable Development Goals
---

Policies for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of guidelines and strategies aimed at achieving the 17 global sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. These policies are designed to address the economic, social, and environmental challenges faced by countries across the world and to promote sustainable development. Policies for SDGs involve various stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, private sector, and individuals, and require their collective efforts to achieve the SDGs. The policies provide a framework for the implementation of sustainable development initiatives and offer a roadmap to ensure that no one is left behind. By adopting policies for SDGs, countries can move towards a sustainable and equitable future.

# MAPS: Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support
The United Nations (UN) has supported countries in Central Asia through the deployment of cross-thematic, multiagency MAPS (Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support) missions. These missions aim to support policy-making for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by identifying gaps, opportunities, and policy solutions in key areas. The MAPS approach includes consultations with government officials, civil society, and other stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the country's development priorities. In Central Asia, MAPS missions have been carried out in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. They have resulted in the development of action plans that focus on areas such as education, health, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. The UN system's support through MAPS missions in Central Asia has helped to strengthen national capacities for SDG implementation and monitoring, and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs in the region.
