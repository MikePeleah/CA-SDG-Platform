# Voluntary national reviews 
Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) are a critical component of the SDGs monitoring process at the national level. VNRs are country-led assessments of progress towards achieving the SDGs and involve the submission of a report by each country to the United Nations. The report presents the country's achievements, challenges, and lessons learned in implementing the SDGs, as well as its plans for future action. VNRs are voluntary, but their submission is highly encouraged and viewed as a way for countries to engage in dialogue and share experiences on SDGs implementation. The VNR process enables countries to learn from each other's experiences and challenges, identify gaps in their policies and strategies, and improve their efforts towards achieving the SDGs. Moreover, VNRs facilitate transparency and accountability, as countries are expected to report on their progress towards the SDGs to their citizens and the international community. By engaging in the VNR process, countries can accelerate their progress towards the SDGs and contribute to the achievement of the global sustainable development agenda.
