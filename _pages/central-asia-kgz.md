**Kyrgyzstan**, a small landlocked country in Central Asia, has made progress in achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) since adopting the agenda in 2015. Kyrgyzstan has taken significant steps to reduce poverty and inequality, promote good health and wellbeing, and provide quality education. In 2020, Kyrgyzstan presented its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the United Nations High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, which outlined the country's progress in implementing the SDGs and identified key challenges that need to be addressed.
