![Flag of Tajikistan]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/TJK_flag_h240.png) **Tajikistan**, a mountainous country in Central Asia, has made significant strides towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) since adopting the agenda in 2015. Tajikistan has made notable progress in reducing poverty, improving access to healthcare and education, and promoting gender equality. In 2017, Tajikistan as an early champion presented its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the United Nations High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, which highlighted the country's progress and identified priorities for future action.
