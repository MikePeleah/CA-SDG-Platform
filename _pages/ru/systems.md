# SDG Systems
A systems thinking approach is increasingly recognized as essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), given the interlinkages and cross-boundary issues among the 17 goals. We need to [unpack these interlinkages](https://www.undp.org/eurasia/blog/keep-it-simple-complexity-and-sdgs) and consider the potential synergies and trade-offs among different SDGs. Cross-boundary issues, such as climate change and inequality, can have impacts on multiple SDGs and require coordinated policy responses. This is a crucial element of sustanable development in Central Asia.

To address this complexity, countries are using various SDG complexity tools, such as systems mapping, scenario planning, and social network analysis. For example, Colombia has used systems mapping to identify the interconnections and leverage points among SDGs, while Thailand has used scenario planning to anticipate the potential impacts of external shocks on SDG progress. Other countries such as Ghana, Indonesia, and Mexico have also employed different complexity tools to better understand and address the interrelated challenges of the SDGs.

# SDG Push Diagnostics for Interlinkages
## Synergies and Tradeoffs
The SDGs do not exist in silos. Understanding the interactions across social, economic and environmental elements of sustainable development is essential to move the needle on the SDGs. SDG Interlinkages show how actions directed towards one SDG can influence the others. Uncovering and understanding these interactions helps in achieving the 2030 Agenda - avoiding the unintended deterioration of the SDGs and their 169 associated targets.
The target-level interlinkages are based on the latest available methodology by the [KnowSDGs Platform by European Commission](https://knowsdgs.jrc.ec.europa.eu/interlinkages-targets). A first literature review ([Miola et al., 2019](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC115163)) was updated and expanded in [2021-2022](https://knowsdgs.jrc.ec.europa.eu/intro-interlinkages) by a team of researchers who retrieved and analysed all relevant scientific and grey literature* on SDG interlinkages, both in Scopus and Google Scholar.

## Cross-border SDG issues

Central Asia, a region encompassing [Kazakhstan]({{ site.baseurl }}/central-asia-kaz/), [Kyrgyzstan]({{ site.baseurl }}/central-asia-kgz/), [Tajikistan]({{ site.baseurl }}/central-asia-tjk/), [Turkmenistan]({{ site.baseurl }}/central-asia-tkm/), and [Uzbekistan]({{ site.baseurl }}/central-asia-uzb/), is a culturally rich and diverse region that has undergone significant social and economic development in recent years. Addressing cross-border issues in Central Asia is the key for achieving SDGs

### Water management
Central Asia is home to several major rivers, including the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, which are shared by multiple countries. Disputes over water allocation, infrastructure development, and pollution are common. One solution is to promote regional cooperation through the establishment of joint institutions, such as the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS), which is supported by the EU and UNDP. Other initiatives include the UNDP's "CAREC Integrated Water Resources Management Project" and the EU's "Central Asia Water-Energy Nexus Dialogue Platform."

### Energy security
Central Asia is a major producer and exporter of oil, gas, and electricity, but many countries still face energy shortages and rely on imports. There is also a need to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The EU's "Central Asia Energy Security Dialogue" and the UNDP's "Regional Dialogue on Energy Security in Central Asia" aim to promote cooperation on energy policy and investment.

### Trade development
Central Asia has enormous potential for trade, but many countries still face barriers to accessing international markets. Promoting trade and economic integration, as well as investing in infrastructure and human capital, can help unlock this potential. The EU's "Supporting the Implementation of WTO TFA in Central Asia" project and the UNDP's "Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Assistance to Least Developed Countries" aim to promote trade facilitation and economic growth.

### Border management
Central Asia has many porous borders, which pose security risks and can impede trade and travel. Promoting transparency and cooperation among border agencies, as well as investing in infrastructure and technology, can help address these challenges. The EU's "Border Management Programme for Central Asia" and the UNDP's "Central Asia Border Security Programme" are working to support these efforts.

### Environmental degradation
Central Asia faces many environmental challenges, including desertification, deforestation, and air and water pollution. These issues often transcend national boundaries and require regional cooperation and policy coordination. The EU's "Central Asia Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and Climate Change" project and the UNDP's "Central Asian Desert Initiative" are working to promote sustainable land use and environmental management.
