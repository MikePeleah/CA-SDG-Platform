# Finances for SDGs
Finance is the lifeblood of sustainable development. Without adequate financing, it is impossible to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The private sector and innovative financing mechanisms can play a critical role in mobilizing resources and scaling up financing for SDGs. 

## UNDP SDG Finance Service Offers
### Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs)
A policy and institutional tool for mobilising and managing public and private finance to support SDG-aligned national plans and to manage risk in the face of future shocks.
### SDG Budgeting
Embedding the SDGs within the allocation and expenditure processes of the national budget to enable scarce public finance to be favourably aligned with the SDGs and national development priorities.
### SDG-Aligned Fiscal and Debt Instruments
Finance for the SDGs can be enhanced through the issuance of debt instruments that align with debt sustainability objectives and leverage finance directly for sustainable development outcomes. 
### Leveraging International Public Finance for the SDGs
International public finance and south-south cooperation have an important role to play in supporting reforms. They must catalyse wider resources and means of implementation to advance the SDGs.
### Unlocking Private Finance for the SDGs
Enabling private sector capital to flow to SDG related investment at scale will require policy and regulatory shifts, better access to information on investment opportunities, and clear standards on the criteria for identification of SDG aligned investment. 
### Aligning Business Strategies and Operations for the SDGs
Adjusting business models to integrate a calculation of sustainable development returns into their balance sheets will help align private sector growth to the SDGs.
### Impact Measurement and SDG Finance Reporting
Strengthening the coherence of government systems to classify and track public finance and the frameworks used by the private sector to report on their development impact is central to generating the data needed for decision makers to mobilize and align finance with the SDGs. 
The dashboard  gives a picture of planned, ongoing and completed activities within SDG Financing in the RBEC countries and territories. It is structured along the seven action areas.
