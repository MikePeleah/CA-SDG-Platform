# Global SDGs monitoring 
Global monitoring of SDGs involves tracking progress towards achieving the 17 sustainable development goals at a global level. The United Nations is responsible for coordinating the global monitoring process, which involves collecting and analyzing data from member countries, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders. The United Nations has designated specific organizations known as "custodian agencies" to lead the monitoring efforts for each of the 17 SDGs. These custodian agencies are responsible for developing and maintaining the indicators used to track progress towards their respective SDGs, as well as collecting and analyzing data from countries and other sources. The global monitoring process, with the support of custodian agencies, helps identify areas where progress is lagging and enables countries to learn from each other's experiences in achieving the SDGs. By monitoring progress at a global level and involving custodian agencies, the international community can assess the effectiveness of policies for SDGs, and adjust strategies and resources accordingly to accelerate progress towards sustainable development.


# National SDGs monitoring 
National monitoring of SDGs involves tracking progress towards achieving the 17 sustainable development goals within a particular country. National monitoring requires the development of indicators, data collection mechanisms, and reporting frameworks that align with the global SDGs monitoring framework. By monitoring progress towards achieving the SDGs at the national level, countries can assess the effectiveness of their policies and strategies and identify areas where they need to improve. National monitoring of SDGs also facilitates the involvement of civil society organizations and other stakeholders in the SDGs implementation process, promoting transparency, accountability, and citizen engagement.

# Regional SDGs monitoring 
Regional monitoring of SDGs involves tracking progress towards achieving the 17 sustainable development goals in a specific region or sub-national area. Regional monitoring is particularly relevant in countries with significant regional disparities in development outcomes and provides a useful mechanism for identifying these disparities and targeting policies and resources to address them. Regional monitoring also facilitates the sharing of best practices and experiences between different regions, promoting learning and cooperation among sub-national entities. By monitoring progress towards the SDGs at the regional level, countries can ensure that sustainable development policies and strategies are tailored to local needs and are effective in promoting regional development.

# Voluntary national reviews 
Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) are a critical component of the SDGs monitoring process at the national level. VNRs are country-led assessments of progress towards achieving the SDGs and involve the submission of a report by each country to the United Nations. The report presents the country's achievements, challenges, and lessons learned in implementing the SDGs, as well as its plans for future action. VNRs are voluntary, but their submission is highly encouraged and viewed as a way for countries to engage in dialogue and share experiences on SDGs implementation. The VNR process enables countries to learn from each other's experiences and challenges, identify gaps in their policies and strategies, and improve their efforts towards achieving the SDGs. Moreover, VNRs facilitate transparency and accountability, as countries are expected to report on their progress towards the SDGs to their citizens and the international community. By engaging in the VNR process, countries can accelerate their progress towards the SDGs and contribute to the achievement of the global sustainable development agenda.
